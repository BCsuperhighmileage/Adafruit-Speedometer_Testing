# Adafruit-Speedometer_Testing
Our testing page for Adafruit ESP32 communication for our speedometer. This project is currently a work in progress and code may not work for you. Use at your own risk.


ToDo List:
- Make the Test Programs work in sync
- Make the Python TCP reciver work with the User interface program.
- Conversion from time-stamps to MPH
- Make sure all the back end is polished before messing with the front end
- Add in the user interface on the Laptop side and make sure that it works fine.
- make it send fake sample data over the whole chain.
- Add in real sensers to the transmitter arduino.
- Clean up the code so that it is readable and make sure that it is safe to be ran out in the feild. 
- Make basic documentation like libraries and hardware use for future reference.
- Make the code an executable file?
- How do we make the code future proof and make sure it does not break during a race, and when it does how to fix it.
